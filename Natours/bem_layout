Block Element Modifier:

.block {
// standalone component, which can be reused anywhere on the project
}

.block__element {
// part of the block, that does not have meaning on its own
}

block__element--modifier {
  // different version of a block or an element
}

7:1 pattern: 7 different folders for partial SASS files and 1 main folder to import all other files
    into a compiled css stylesheet

7 Folders:
base - basic project definitions
components - one file per component
layout - layouts of the project
pages - styles for specific pages of the project
themes - different visual themes
abstracts - keep variables and mixins
vendors - third party css
