// produce block:
display: block / flex / list-item / table

block level box always occupies as much space as possible. Usuall 100% of it's parent width. Will also create line
breaks before itself and after

inline: only occupies content's space, no line breaks, no height and no width,
        pading and margin only left and right

inline-block: occupies only content space, no line breaks. Has all box model properties

// positioning: normal flow, absolute positioning, floats

normal flow: elements are laid out on the page in the natural order of the code.
not normal flow: position: absolute and float. The rest are normal. Including position: relative

floats: left or right. Element is removed from normal flow. Text and inline elements will wrap around the 
        floated element. The container will not adjust its height to the element. Will need to clear.

position: absolute or fixed. No impact on surounding elements. Use top, bottom, left, right to offset
          the element from its relatively positioned container.

stacking context: order of layering. Use z-index / opacity / transform
